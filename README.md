# Form_Builder_Avlokan

## Create a dynamic form builder application that allows users to create, edit, and save forms with various input types (e.g., text, number, date, checkbox).
Features:
        Users can add different types of form fields dynamically.
        Users can rearrange the order of form fields.
        Users can save the form structure to local storage or a mock API.
        Users can load and edit saved forms.

 Additional Requirements:
        Use React state management (e.g., Context API or Redux) to manage form state.
        Implement form validation for required fields.
